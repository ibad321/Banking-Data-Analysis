# Banking Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a banking dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights, generating various plots, and proposing the data for further analysis. Additionally, multiple machine learning models are applied and evaluated to predict outcomes based on the dataset.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
   - Generation of various plots to visualize the data and gain insights.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Preprocessing the data for machine learning models.

4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Application of several machine learning algorithms:
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Naive Bayes
   - Evaluation of these models to determine their performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Google Colab:** The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for this project.
- **Python Libraries:** 
  - Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models.
